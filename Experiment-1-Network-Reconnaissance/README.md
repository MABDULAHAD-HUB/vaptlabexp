# 🛰️ Experiment 1: Network Reconnaissance & Footprinting

## 🧠 Objective  
Identify active hosts, open ports, and running services within a target network subnet using reconnaissance tools.

## 🏢 Scenario  
**TechSecure Corp** suspects that its internal LAN might host unpatched services. As an external consultant, your role is to gather intelligence with limited initial access.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Nmap** – For host discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration  
- **Amass** – For passive reconnaissance (e.g., subdomains, metadata)

## 📄 Deliverable  
A network inventory report listing:
- Discovered IP addresses  
- Guessed operating systems  
- Active services and ports
