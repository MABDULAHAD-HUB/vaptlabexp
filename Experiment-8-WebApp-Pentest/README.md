# 🧪 Experiment 8: Full Web Application Penetration Test

## 🧠 Objective  
Conduct a full-scale penetration test on the OWASP Juice Shop to identify and exploit common web application vulnerabilities.

## 🏢 Scenario  
You have been tasked with performing a comprehensive security test on OWASP Juice Shop before it goes live. The goal is to uncover vulnerabilities and demonstrate their impact.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **OWASP ZAP** – For automated scanning and spidering  
- **Browser Dev Tools / Manual Testing** – For exploiting discovered vulnerabilities  

## 🧪 Tasks  
- Scan the application using OWASP ZAP  
- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities such as:  
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)  
  - Broken Authentication  
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)  
- Recommend mitigations for each issue

## 📄 Deliverable  
- A penetration test report including:  
  - Discovered vulnerabilities  
  - Proof-of-exploitation (screenshots/logs)  
  - Suggested remediations
