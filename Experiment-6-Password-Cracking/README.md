# 🧪 Experiment 6: Password Cracking & Credential Harvesting

## 🧠 Objective  
Demonstrate how weak passwords can be cracked using hash-based attacks and assess the risks of poor credential practices.

## 🏢 Scenario  
A list of hashed passwords (generated using an MD5 hash generator) is available for testing. The goal is to evaluate how easily an attacker could crack them using common tools.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **John the Ripper** – For cracking MD5 password hashes  
- **Hydra** – Optional, for brute-forcing FTP logins on Metasploitable 2

## 📄 Deliverable  
- List of cracked passwords  
- Recommendations to improve password strength
