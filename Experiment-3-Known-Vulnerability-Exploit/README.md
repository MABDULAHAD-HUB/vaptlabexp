# 💥 Experiment 3: Exploiting a Known Vulnerability

## 🧠 Objective  
Demonstrate exploitation of a critical vulnerability to highlight potential risks.

## 🏢 Scenario  
Your scan discovered a critical vulnerability in a target server (e.g., the vsftpd backdoor in Metasploitable 2). The goal is to perform a proof-of-concept exploit to assess possible impact.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Metasploit Framework** – Used to exploit the known vsftpd vulnerability and gain shell access

## 📄 Deliverable  
- A screenshot and log of a successful exploit session  
- Notes on the level of access obtained and potential data exposure
