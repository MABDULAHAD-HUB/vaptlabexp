# 🛡️ Experiment 2: Vulnerability Scanning & Assessment

## 🧠 Objective  
Identify known vulnerabilities in discovered systems using automated scanning tools.

## 🏢 Scenario  
After identifying a web server and a file-sharing server, you're tasked with assessing their security posture to identify weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Nikto** – To scan the web application (e.g., DVWA) for misconfigurations, outdated components, and common issues
- ~~**OpenVAS** – To perform a detailed vulnerability scan on a Linux server (e.g., Metasploitable 2)~~  
  ❌ *Note: OpenVAS was not performed due to login issues encountered during setup.*

## 📄 Deliverable  
A vulnerability assessment report containing:
- Discovered vulnerabilities  
- CVE references  
- Risk severity ratings
