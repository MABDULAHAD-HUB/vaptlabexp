# 🧪 Experiment 8: Privilege Escalation on a Compromised Host

## 🧠 Objective  
Demonstrate post-exploitation techniques to escalate privileges from a non-root user to root on a compromised Linux system.

## 🏢 Scenario  
Access has been gained to a Linux server with limited user privileges. The goal is to assess whether a malicious actor could elevate to root using known techniques or misconfigurations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **LinPEAS** – For local privilege escalation enumeration 

## 📄 Deliverable  
- A screenshot showing root access (`id` command)  
- A brief explanation of the exploited vulnerability (e.g., vulnerable kernel, SUID misconfiguration)
