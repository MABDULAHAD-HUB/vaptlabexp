# 🐛 Experiment 4: SQL Injection Attacks on Web Applications

## 🧠 Objective  
Validate the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities and assess the impact of data extraction.

## 🏢 Scenario  
The DVWA application’s login and search functionalities are suspected to be vulnerable due to improper input validation. The goal is to confirm if attackers can extract sensitive backend data using SQL injection.

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **SQLMap** – Automated SQL injection and database takeover tool  
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** – Target for injection testing

## 📄 Deliverable  
- Screenshots and logs of extracted database entries  
- Brief report on the nature of the vulnerability and its risk to the organization
